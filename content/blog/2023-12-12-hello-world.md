Hello world, welcome to my little corner of the internet!  
This post marks the beginning of my blogging journey.
You might be thinking: what will this blog be about?
<!-- more -->

That's a great question! It will be about whatever comes to my mind.
It can be about technical projects I'm interested about, such as
Linux, Android, Home Assistant, NixOS, and much more; or it can be about
my personal life or any other subject I fancy.

The first "real" post should be coming up soonâ„¢, and it will about
my journey moving abroad.
I have a few more posts planned about a home router running NixOS,
Android ROM installation and development, and more.

Feel free to subscribe the RSS feed in your favorite reader to not
lose the upcoming posts.

See you soon!
