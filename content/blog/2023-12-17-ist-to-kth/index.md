A little over a year ago, due to my own interests but also some
peer pressure from my friends and family, I started thinking about the possibility
of studying abroad, either for the whole masters, or only for one or two semesters.
This is the story of all the twists and turns in my journey to end up studying
in the [MSc Cybersecurity at KTH], in Sweden.

## How It Started

During the summer break, some of my friends started discussing studying abroad.
Initially, I was just reading the messages they were sending while they investigated the
various universities they were interested in applying to, but eventually I started doing
some research myself.
Interestingly enough, while KTH was mentioned at the time, I had not considered it
as one of my choices, which mostly consisted of universities in the Netherlands.

As weeks came and went, I got drowned in assignments and pushed aside submitting
any applications, mainly due to dreading the work involved with getting all the
legal paperwork necessary. Looking back, getting the required documents was not
that big of a headache all things considered (more on that later).

Around October, some of my friends started considering doing Erasmus instead.
It was a very appealing proposition: I would still get the experience of studying and
living abroad (and moving out of my parent's house), while enjoying a hassle free
application (it would be just a few clicks in my university's website).
Granted, it would not look as good on my CV as a full-blown masters abroad, but it
would still be relevant.
Furthermore, at the time I had considered doing it for two semesters and not just
one (as, as far as I was aware, it would be allowed).
For this reason, I was mostly interested in doing Erasmus starting in the first
semester of my masters, in order to avoid doing the thesis abroad.

Taking into the account the available destination universities from previous years,
I ended up picking [UvAmsterdam], [TU/Delft] and [TUMunich] as my top choices.
Again, at this point, despite being one of the options, KTH was still not on my radar,
mainly because of me never having heard of it.

## Where It All Fell Apart

With everything already planned and ready for the Erasmus applications on the 3rd of
January of 2023, there was nothing to do but wait (and enjoy the deserved Christmas break!).
After all, what could go wrong? _A lot, it turns out._

To have the necessary context of what happened here, we need to go back to 2021,
when a structural change of the programmes was introduced at my university,
TÃ©cnico Lisboa (IST), called MEPP.
Amongst other (overall disliked) changes, the 5 year bachelor + masters programmes
were broken apart into 3 and 2 year programmes, respectively.
Perhaps the most notable consequence was that students are no longer guaranteed
a spot on the masters, and instead have to apply if they want to continue their
studies after the bachelor.

You might already see where this is going.

Even though we had enrolled in the bachelor in 2020, before these changes were
implemented, and therefore had a guaranteed spot on the masters due to the
transition, our eligibility to do Erasmus in the first semester was still dubious.
With this in mind, and knowing that the class one year older than us had had the
same problem the year prior, my friends and I decided to reach out to both the
Mobility Coordinator for our programme, as well as the Mobility and International
Cooperation Office (NMCI) at your school, well in advance (around October/November).
After exposing our exact situation, and highlighting the problems the year prior,
both said we would be allowed to do what we were planning to.
While my friend contacted the Mobility Coordinator by email, another friend and I went
in person to NMCI to ask our questions, and ended up not having any record of
that conversation.

On the 3rd of January of 2023, all hell broke loose when the applications opened
and were accompanied by a note published the day prior by the school, saying that
having completed 30 ECTS of master-level courses would be required to apply.
Upon hearing the news, we were, understandably, feeling angry, upset, betrayed,
and a myriad of other emotions that no words could describe (I might be
exaggerating a bit, but we were pretty mad).
