    At this time, I started to have some interest in coding.
    In May 2014, I joined the [Bukkit](https://bukkit.org/) community,
    started learning Java and created my first Minecraft server.

    After a few months of work, I've managed to create a Minecraft server
    with custom plugins!
    We also had a website with PayPal support to allow for donations, all custom made.
    The server was closed later that year, so I've decided to
    [open source most of the code](https://bitbucket.org/account/user/islandcraftgames/projects/ICG).

    I joined a development team called Clout Team, which has since been taken down.

    While working for Clout Team, I've started receiving money for programming,
    which was a huge achievement for me!

    After closing IslandCraftGames, I decided to use some of the code to create
    a really seamless translation plugin and sell it on
    [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/triton.30331/) as MultiLanguagePlugin.
    It has since been rebranded to [Triton](https://triton.rexcantor64.com/).

    After 6 months of work, everything was ready for [Craftathon 2017](https://2017.craftathon.org/)!
    I joined other developers to create an amazing charity event in Minecraft,
    which was able to raise _\$6,455.23_ for [Child's Play Charity](https://childsplaycharity.org/),
    improving the lives of children in domestic violence shelters and hospitals!
    I mainly worked on the website back-end, mostly on the payment system.

    After Craftathon ended, I didn't have anything to do, so I made myself a challenge:
    create a [fully working Minecraft server software from scratch](https://github.com/Clout-Team/JarCraftinator).  
    **The goal?** Learn more about how socket connections work in Java.
    And after a week I got my first loaded chunk!
    The project is far from finished and it will probably stay that way,
    but it was fun to do nonetheless.

    an _«Adventure for Charity»_ and a triple ironman triathlon.
    Portugal Ultra Triathlon is a solidary adventure and a triple ironman.
    Its mission is to challenge participants' limits and their resilience,
    generate social value and supporting local communities.  
    I was behind the entire internet presence of the event,
    from the website itself down to the donation system and sysadmin work
    (setting up emails, custom domains, etc).

    Sysadmin work was also done to setup the web and email servers.
